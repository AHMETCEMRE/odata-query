   AST
      Abstract Syntax Tree. A tree data structure representing the syntactic
      structure of some text. For example, in OData we might write
      ``name eq 'Bobby'``, which could be represented as the tree:
      ``Compare(Eq, Identifier('name'), String('Bobby'))``. For more,
      see `Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree>`_
